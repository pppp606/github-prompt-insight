# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to extend the existing DB backup functionality that is currently available in the /workspaces pages to also be available in the /seets directory pages. The feature will reuse the existing modal component to maintain consistency across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing pages under the /seets directory, I want to have access to the same DB backup button that is available in the /workspaces pages, so that I can perform database backups from either location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page under the /seets directory THEN the system SHALL display a DB backup button in a consistent location as it appears in the /workspaces pages.
2. WHEN a user clicks the DB backup button in the /seets directory THEN the system SHALL display the same modal that is used in the /workspaces pages.
3. WHEN a user initiates a DB backup from the /seets directory THEN the system SHALL perform the backup operation with the same functionality as when initiated from the /workspaces directory.
4. WHEN the DB backup modal is displayed from a /seets page THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality of the modal.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reuse the existing modal component for DB backups, so that I can maintain code consistency and reduce duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the DB backup button for /seets pages THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing modal component without duplicating code.
2. WHEN the DB backup functionality is updated in the future THEN the system SHALL ensure changes apply consistently to both /workspaces and /seets implementations.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent UI experience across different sections of the application, so that I can easily understand and use the DB backup functionality regardless of which page I'm on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DB backup button is displayed in the /seets pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual style, position, and behavior as in the /workspaces pages.
2. WHEN hovering over the DB backup button in either location THEN the system SHALL display the same tooltip or helper text.
3. WHEN the DB backup operation completes THEN the system SHALL display the same success/error notifications regardless of which page initiated the backup.
